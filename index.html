    <h2 class="text-center">How to not completely suck at Rocket League</h2>
      <p class="text-center">So you want to get good at Rocket League. Where should you start?</p>
    <ul>
      <h2 class="text-center" id="Intro">Intro</h2>
        <p class="text-center">The barrier to entry for Rocket League is low, but putting the game down once you start is a struggle. Games are short, fast-paced and addictive. If you are committed to this game you will see improvement.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3 class="text-center" id="Basics">Basics</h3>
        <h4>Customize the camera settings</h4>
        <p>Often times your camera settings are a big issue in gameplay. Too high of a settings and you cant accurately predict the ball, and too low you cant see the game. Your gonna want something in the middle so you can see the field and be accurate. </p>
        <p>I suggest something around this 110 100 250 -5 .50</p>
        <img src="camera.jpg" alt="Camera settings" height="400">
        <h4>Learn to rotate</h4>
        <p>Unless your playing 1v1s rotation is crucial in the game of Rocket League. Rotation is when you the player go back to your half of the field to support your teammate and make sure you don't get scored on. </p>
        <img src="rotation.jpg" alt="Rotation" height="400">
        <h4>Use the brake</h4>
        <p>When playing Rocket League the ball is very fast and active on the field at all times. You need to keep up with everyone on the field to stay in the game but often times not braking / giving yourself time will lead to your downfall in the game.</p>
        <h4>Pass over shooting</h4>
        <p>Trust is a big thing in Rocket League but playing with your team is the right way to play Rocket League effectively. Unless you have an open goal then you should be looking for your teammate at all times.</p>
        <h4>Don't get hung up on ranks</h4>
        <p>When you focus on where you are at on the skill leaderboard you tunnel vision on what matters. You should be playing for fun and to improve if thats your thing, don't judge how you play based on your rank.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h2 class="text-center" id="Advanced">Advanced</h2>
        <h4 id="Training">Training</h4>
        <p>The first advanced tip I would say is play free play. This is the key to improving you can do anything you want. You can practice mechanics, hitting the ball, speed, etc. This is the backbone of improvement you have endless options and free rein of how you play</p>
        <h4 id="Mechanics">Mechanics</h4>
        <p>You should practice mechanics but which ones?</p>
        <p>These are mechanics you see in every game you should practice and master these before moving on to the stylish looking mechanics such as ceiling shots.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Dribbling</li>
          <li>Aerialing</li>
          <li>Flicking</li>
          <li>Wave-dashing</li>
          <li>Speed</li>
          <li>Air Dribbles</li>
          <li>Backboard touches</li>
          <li>Kickoffs</li>

        <h4 id="Drills">Drills</h4>
